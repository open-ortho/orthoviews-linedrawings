<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Orthodontic providers use mainly a limited set of images. The American Dental
Association Standards Committee for Dental Informatics has published White
Paper 1100, which defines each of these images. An artist has been
commissioned to produce a drawing of each view, in order to eliminate
ambiguity.

These drawings, however, may be useful for developers. For example, they
could be used as placeholders for images in their user interface, in order to
facilitate the enduser in identifying which specific photograph needs to be
uploaded.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The images are in the `images/` folder of the repository.

No installation is required. You can download the images by cloning this repository.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage Examples

- Placeholders in User Interface
- Sample data for unit tests
